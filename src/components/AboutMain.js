        <strong>I used to be a pack rat.</strong>I had so many things that I
        thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any
        of it because there was too much.
        <br />
        <br />
        Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't
        want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.

          How I turned things around I was on the verge of a breakdown when I
          got rid of everything.
        </strong>
        I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and
        moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
        <br />
        <br />
        It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place,
        I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.

        Now I live the simple life Now that I'm living a simple life, things are
        so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have
        more free time to enjoy.
        <br />
        <br />
        With how much it turned my life around,
        <strong>
          I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it
        </strong>
        , and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is
        why I started this site!
